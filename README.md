Now the world is changing towards being cashless, so every business wants to go online.
Influx of more websites within the same content area, requires businesses to use new tactics such as clickbaits and gamification to draw in more users towards their businesses.
This repository contains our work on clickbait detection and its effect on human behaviour.
We tried to analyse how clickbait affects human behaviour and used different techniques such as gamification in our survey to get more user engagement, unified 3 different but related fields (clickbait, Fogg Behaviour Model and gamification) in this work.
We worked with one resource rich language English and one resource poor language Bengali and proposed a computational model to implement Fogg Behaviour Model.
As a result our Bengali model (bangla-BERT-base) beat our best English model (BERT-base-uncased) in accuracy.
We got accuracy of 88% and 95% for both of our English and Bengali models respectively.
